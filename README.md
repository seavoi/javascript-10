Treehouse JavaScript // Full Stack App with React and a REST API

Sean Voigts (https://teamtreehouse.com/projects/full-stack-app-with-react-and-a-rest-api)

## Greetings

## Next Steps:
Stuck while creating a course - Error "Data.createCourse" line 65 - API says Authentication failure for username

Might need to revisit Protected Routes - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-authentication/react-router-and-authentication/protect-routes-that-require-authentication 

## To-do List:
Write password match verification for UserSignUp
The REST API has been updated with support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
