## Next Steps:
Stuck while creating a course - Error "Data.createCourse" line 65 - API says Authentication failure for username

Write password match verification for UserSignUp

Might need to revisit Protected Routes - https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-authentication/react-router-and-authentication/protect-routes-that-require-authentication
